deep-freeze
===========

Watch for specific files and back the new ones up to Amazon Glacier storage every so often

Files to be put into 'deep freeze' are...

 - Personal Pictures
 - Personal Video
 - Purchased Music
 - Personal Documents

And other files that are not meant to change over time but need to be backed up to an inexpensive remote location.

These files ideally will never be retreived from Glacier storage, but will be available in case other means of backup have failed.
